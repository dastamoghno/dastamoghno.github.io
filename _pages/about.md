I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine, focusing on computer architecture, AI hardware accelerators, and processing-in-memory systems.

My research interests include:
- Processing-in-memory (PIM)
- Machine learning accelerator hardware/software co-design
- Energy-efficient AI architectures (HDC, SNN)
- Neurosymbolic AI


I have previously earned a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
