My teaching interests reflect my research background in computer architecture and AI hardware systems. Topics I am prepared to teach or support include:

- Computer architecture and hardware acceleration (graduate/advanced undergraduate level)
- Energy-efficient AI systems and emerging architectures
- Electrical engineering foundations informed by my M.S. training at IIT Delhi

I am happy to share sample syllabi or guest lecture materials upon request.
