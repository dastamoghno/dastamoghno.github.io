I give research talks on topics aligned with my work in computer architecture and AI hardware acceleration. Recent and recurring themes include:

- Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures and systems
- Machine learning accelerator hardware/software co-design
- Energy-efficient AI architectures (HDC, SNN)
- Neurosymbolic AI

If you're interested in hosting a talk, please reach out and I can share a tailored abstract.
