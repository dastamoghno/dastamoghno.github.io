I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, focusing on computer architecture, AI hardware accelerators, and processing-in-memory systems. My research interests include:

- Processing-in-memory (PIM)
- Machine learning accelerator hardware/software co-design
- Energy-efficient AI architectures (HDC, SNN)
- Neurosymbolic AI

I previously earned a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. Explore my [Publications](/publications/), [Talks](/talks/), [Teaching](/teaching/), or view my [CV](/cv/).
